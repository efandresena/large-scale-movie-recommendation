# Large-scale-movie-recommendation
A from-scratch implementation of a scalable movie recommendation system. 

The notebook ipynb documents each development step, and the final modular Python implementation will be included in the latest version.
Important note the ipynb won't work for now because of the  fixed path. The final model will be modular with python py format.
